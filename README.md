# d-quant-app

This is a web-based GUI prototype for the D-Quant single note generator. It previews musical expression parameters using pre-rendered music symbols and eventually connects to a backend that generates MIDI and breath envelope PNGs.

## Folder Structure

- `html/` – Static HTML layouts (e.g. preview.html)
- `images/` – Music symbol PNGs used in the UI
- `output/` – Generated MIDI and PNG files (ignored by Git)

## Getting Started

Open the HTML preview in a browser:

```sh
cd html
open preview.html  # or use your browser to open the file manually
